## 1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì What is Inheritance?

**Inheritance** allows one class (derived class) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (base class).
<br>
Syntax:

```cpp
class Derived : access_specifier Base {
   // additional members
};
```

‚úÖ Key Points:

- Promotes code reusability.
- Enables hierarchical class structures.
- Supports polymorphism.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Base-Class Access Control

Access specifiers control how base class members are inherited.

| Access in Base | `public` inheritance | `protected` inheritance | `private` inheritance |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| `public`       | public in derived    | protected in derived    | private in derived    |
| `protected`    | protected in derived | protected in derived    | private in derived    |
| `private`      | not accessible       | not accessible          | not accessible        |

Example:

```cpp
class Base {
public: int a;
protected: int b;
private: int c;
};

class Derived : public Base {
    // a ‚Üí public, b ‚Üí protected, c ‚Üí not accessible
};
```

‚úÖ Commonly used:
`public` inheritance ‚Üí "is-a" relationship.
Example: `Car` is a `Vehicle`.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Inheritance and Protected Members

Protected members of a base class are accessible only within:

- The base class itself.
- Any **derived class** (but not from outside).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
protected:
    int value;
public:
    Base(int v) { value = v; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived(int v) : Base(v) {}
    void show() { cout << "Value = " << value; } // accessible
};

int main() {
    Derived d(10);
    d.show();
}
```

‚úÖ Key Point: `protected` = like `private` outside the class, but accessible inside derived classes.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Protected Base-Class Inheritance

When a class is inherited using `protected`, both public and protected members of base class become protected in the derived class.

```cpp
class A {
public: int x;
protected: int y;
};

class B : protected A {
public:
    void show() { cout << x << " " << y; } // both accessible
};

int main() {
    B obj;
    // obj.x; ‚ùå Error - becomes protected in B
}
```

‚úÖ Use case: When you want derived classes to use base features, but `don‚Äôt expose them publicly`.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Inheriting Multiple Base Classes

C++ supports multiple inheritance, meaning a class can inherit from `more than one base class`.<br>
Syntax:

```cpp
class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
    // members
};
```

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A { public: void showA() { cout << "A "; } };
class B { public: void showB() { cout << "B "; } };
class C : public A, public B {
public: void showC() { cout << "C"; }
};

int main() {
    C obj;
    obj.showA();
    obj.showB();
    obj.showC();
}
```

‚úÖ Output: A B C

‚úÖ Key Points:

- If both base classes have same function name, ambiguity occurs.
  Use `scope resolution` (e.g., `A::display();`).
- Common problem: `Diamond problem` ‚Üí solved by `virtual base classes` (explained later).

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Constructors, Destructors, and Inheritance

Rules:

- **Base class constructors** are called first, then **derived class** constructors.
- **Destructor**s are called in reverse order.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() { cout << "Base Constructor\n"; }
    ~Base() { cout << "Base Destructor\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { cout << "Derived Constructor\n"; }
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived Destructor\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
}
```

‚úÖ Output:

```txt
Base Constructor
Derived Constructor
Derived Destructor
Base Destructor
```

‚úÖ Key Point: Always ensure base destructors are virtual if base pointers delete derived objects.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì When Constructors and Destructors Are Executed

**Execution Order:**

- Constructors:
  `‚Üí Base ‚Üí Derived`

- Destructors:
  `‚Üí Derived ‚Üí Base`

If multiple inheritance is used:
‚Üí Constructors executed left to right (based on inheritance list).

```cpp
class A { public: A() { cout<<"A "; } };
class B { public: B() { cout<<"B "; } };
class C : public A, public B { public: C() { cout<<"C"; } };
```

‚úÖ Output: A B C

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Passing Parameters to Base-Class Constructors

Derived class constructors can pass arguments to base class constructors using an **initializer list**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
    int a;
public:
    Base(int x) { a = x; cout << "Base " << a << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
    int b;
public:
    Derived(int x, int y) : Base(x) { b = y; cout << "Derived " << b << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Derived d(5, 10);
}
```

‚úÖ Output:

```nginx
Base 5
Derived 10
```

‚úÖ Key Point:

- You must use member initializer list for calling parameterized base constructors.
- If not explicitly called, default constructor of base runs automatically.

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Granting Access (Friendship and Protected)

A derived class cannot automatically access private members of base class.
To give access:

- Declare base members as protected (for inheritance access), or
- Use a friend class/function.

```cpp
class Base {
    int x = 10;
    friend class Derived;
};

class Derived {
public:
    void show(Base b) { cout << b.x; } // allowed (friend)
};
```

‚úÖ Key Point:

- Friendship is not inherited.
- A friend function can access private/protected data of a class.

## üîü ‚Äì Virtual Base Classes

Used to solve diamond (ambiguity) problem in multiple inheritance.

**Problem Example:**

```cpp
class A { public: int x; };
class B : public A { };
class C : public A { };
class D : public B, public C { };
```

Here D inherits x twice (once via B, once via C).

**Solution ‚Üí Use Virtual Base Class**

```cpp
class A { public: int x; };
class B : virtual public A { };
class C : virtual public A { };
class D : public B, public C { };

int main() {
    D obj;
    obj.x = 10;   // no ambiguity
}
```

‚úÖ Key Points:

- Declared using keyword virtual before public.
- Ensures only one copy of base class members exists.
- Prevents data duplication in multiple inheritance.
